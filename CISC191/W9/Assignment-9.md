## Task 2

**2. Draw what the previous heap would look like after we delete the root node.**


Assuming that the previous heap is referring to the heap after we inserted the 11, the resulting heap would look as follows:

## Task 3

**3. Imagine youâ€™ve built a brand-new heap by inserting the following numbers into the heap in this particular order: 55, 22, 34, 10, 2, 99, 68. If you then pop them from the heap one at a time and insert the numbers into a new array, in what order would the numbers now appear?**



The numbers would appear in the following order: [99, 68, 55, 34, 22, 10, 2].
